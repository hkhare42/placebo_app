You're fantastic.
You're the best.
Love you baby!
You astonish me.
You're a virtuoso.
Your sagacity is stunning.
You're a glitterbomb of glory.
Your genius would be alarming, if it wasn't so damn consistent.
You're a marvel, mama.
You've blinded me with science!
You just revived my faith in humanity.
I want to orbit around your splendor like a satellite.
I want to clone you for nefarious purposes.
I want to Xerox everything you say, and fax it straight to my cortex.
You're a polished opal in a pewter world.
You're luminous, lady.
You're a smooooth criminal.
You're all that and a bag of kale chips.
You are FAR fucking OUT!
You blow my mind like a Cat 5 hurricane.
When did you get so wise, woman?
Where did you pick up those sexy mind-moves?
BOOM! Brilliance strikes again.
Color me enlightened.
Radiance abounds.
I'm honored to share even a miniscule fraction of your miraculous DNA.
If it wasn't completely inappropriate and biologically impossible, I'd be having ALL your babies.
Your acumen is making me weak in the knees.
You're like a laser beam in the night. So bright. So right.
You're more addicting that Twilight, The Hunger Games and street-grade cocaine, intertwined.
You're so fantasmagoric, I almost wanna join Facebook — just to stalk you.
You are simply … beyond.
You foxy freak of nature!
You're the cat's meow, the dog's howl, and the curmudgeon's harrumph — all rolled into one.
You're the genuine article, baby.
Do they sell you in bulk? And can I pre-order?
May I have one of you in every color?
Aaaaany chance you're up for adoption?
You ooze ingenuity.
Your ebullience is infectious.
You're a charmer.
You're a prize.
You're my personal Yoda.
You remind me what 'possible' feels like.
You dazzle me to the core.
I like the cut of your jib.
I hang on your every tweet.
One in a million? More like one a googolplex.
You're a revelation.
You're a machine. More, plz.
Your mediocre ideas are MENSA-level hotness.
You redefine 'divine'.
You matter. Full stop.
